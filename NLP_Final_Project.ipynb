On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion &amp; Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\" In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded, \"We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings &amp; Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt.\" Madison's original draft of the Bill of Rights had included provisions binding the States, as well as the Federal Government, from an establishment of religion, but the House did not pass them.[citation needed]</td>\n",

Thankfully, the tokenizer we're using can help us with that by returning an offset_mapping, It’s a list of (start_char, end_char) tuples for each token, Each tuple tells you which characters in the original input text the token corresponds to, The very first token ([CLS]) has (0, 0) because it doesn't correspond to any part of the question/answer, This is very useful for tasks like question answering, where after the model predicts token positions, you want to map them back to the exact text span in the original context."

Since our preprocessing changes the number of samples, we need to remove the old columns when applying it, Note that we passed batched=True to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently."
